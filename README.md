# Status

[![Build Status](https://drone.gravityhub.org/api/badges/Gravity-Tech/gateway/status.svg)](https://drone.gravityhub.org/Gravity-Tech/gateway)

# Build

**make ethereum** - build ethereum contracts and update abi

**make waves** - build waves contracts and update abi

**Ergo** - Ergo is based on UTXO and there is another project used as a proxy for susy with some functionalities and contracts control the process (You can check `ergo-susy-proxy` project). So there is no need to make abi from ergo contracts.
